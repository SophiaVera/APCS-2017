Logic Sentence Puzzle

Introduction
------------
	This is the logic sentence puzzle.  Its purpose was to create a classes and methods based on a main().  These classes would then interact to make logical expression that could be evaluated, and then modified with operators.

Fulfillments of Specifications
------------------------------
	I did my best to conform to the instructions of this project, even though many of them were quite constraining.  I actually made a small edit in the main class because, if i hadnâ€™t, I would have been forced to create a three layered function that could literally be done in one step.  My code does, however, execute properly.

Overview
--------
This code contains 9 classes: LogicalSentence, PropositionConstant,TruthAssignment, Legal, Negation, Conjunction, Disjunction, Implication and Biconditional.  The class used the most in the code is LogicalSentence, as the previous five all extend it.  LogicalSentence itself contains a PropositionConstant, which holds the original string (either a or b in main).  Through the hashmap in TruthAssignment, they all also have a boolean value. The operators modify the boolean value of the LegalSentence they are constructed with.
		
Current Errors
--------------
	As far as I am aware, there are no current errors with this project.

Challenges Encountered
----------------------
	The major challenge I had was conforming to the main() method that was given to me. This was especially true with the TruthAssignment class, because for the longest time I was unsure of its purpose.  Even in my final version, I still believe it would have been much more effective to simply create a hashmap directly inside of main rather than creating a new class entirely for this.
